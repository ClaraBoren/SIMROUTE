# SIMROUTE
SIMROUTE: Weather Ship Routing Code.
The software is constructed considering available Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) wave predictions systems of free use. 
The code provides the optimized route and the minimum distance (i.e. geodetic) route jointly additional modules to compute ship emission and
safety on navigation monitoring. SIMROUTE has been used in several scientific problems in short and long-distance routes including real routes 
comparison from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and may be useful also as inter-comparison of more sophisticated methods. 
SIMROUTE is also used for academic purposes providing skills of ship routing optimization, to assess the impact of the meteo-oceanographic 
on ship navigation and to highlight the relevance of ship routing in the framework of standards of training, certification and watchkeeping (STCW) 
competences-based maritime education and training. This paper highlights the technical aspects, user organization and structure behind SIMROUTE, 
demonstrating its capabilities by maritime problems examples.
